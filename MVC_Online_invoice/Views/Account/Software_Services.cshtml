                    <div class="course_demo" style="margin-top: 8px;">
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">ERP is being positioned as the foundation and integration of enterprise-wide information systems. Such systems will link together all of a company's operations including human resources, financials, manufacturing and distribution as well as connect the organisation to its customers and suppliers.    </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="course_demo" style="margin-top: 8px;">
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">ERP is often referred to as back-office software. It doesn't handle the up-front selling process (although most ERP vendors have recently developed CRM software to do this); rather, ERP takes a customer order and provides a software road map for automating the different steps along the path to fulfilling it. When a customer service representative enters a customer order into an ERP system,he has all the information necessary to complete the order (the customer's credit rating and order history from the finance module,the company's inventory levels from the warehouse module and the shipping dock's trucking schedule from the logistics module). </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="course_demo" style="margin-top: 8px;">
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">People in these different departments all see the same information and can update it.When one department finishes with the order it is automatically routed through the ERP system to the next department.To find out where the order is at any point,you need only log in to the ERP system and track it down.The order process moves like a bolt of lightning through the organisation and customers get their orders faster and with fewer errors than before.ERP can apply that same magic to the other major business processes,such as employee benefits or financial reporting. </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management. As the central goal of every business is to serve its customers, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) in recent times has emerged as a way of using technology to do just that. Using CRM, businesses can learn more about customer needs and behaviors in order to develop stronger relationships with them and also to formulate strategies to optimize communication and mould the business around their needs We help companies decide on the right on-demand CRM solutions and services, helping companies increase profitability by improving customer value and reducing operating costs. ZITS can help you streamline your customer service processes to ensure consistently high service levels, quick response times, accountability and problem resolution. In the last few years, the market for on-demand CRM has soared particularly among small and mid-sized companies, largely because of fears about the expense, duration and complexity of large-scale on-premise CRM implementations. And indeed, on-demand CRM is often a good choice for companies looking to implement standard CRM processes and are able to use out-of-the-box features, with little or no internal IT support, and don’t require complex or real-time integration with back office systems. With all these occurrences in the CRM market, Zits has grown into a full-fledged on-demand CRM services provider which helps companies not only decide on the right provider but also does deliver implementation, consulting, data migration, cleansing, training and integration services. The penetration of our Internet technologies as a business process enabler has allowed companies to develop efficient, scalable, multi-channel customer interactive systems that reduce the cost of contact and enhance services. Our CRM solutions do help in meeting the challenges that some companies are facing in retaining customers and keeping sales costs under control.
